  		<p>FS2C's mission is to create opportunities for the next generation of black and brown children in inner cities through art initiatives. 		By creating art, merchandise and throwing events we are able to donate proceeds from our endeavors to programs that service children in 		the Dorchester, Roxbury and Mattapan neighborhoods of Boston. </p>

 		 <h1>"The Inspiration" for FS2C</h1>
 	 	<p>Born in the late 80's, grew up in the 90's and really came of age in the 00's all while living in Dorchester and spending much time in 		other city neighborhoods like Roxbury and Mattapan; Hip-Hop culture, street art and current events of the time were major influences on 		the artist GBFree who created FromStreet2Canvas.</p>

			<h2>"Life Influences Art"</h2>

			<ul>
 	 		<li>The Street/Urban Art scene of the 70's to 90's</li>
  			<li>The grueling journey of Black people in the USA from 1619 to the present</li>
  			<li>Hip Hop culture and its ascent to the mainstream from the 80s, 90s and early 00s</li>
			</ul>  
		</section>

		<p>The ability to collaborate with other like minded indivduals is crucial, where its with fellow artists, non-profits or individuals looking to support the movement.</p>

		<p>Since the pandemic I've been able to connect with an amazing collective of renowned artists, including ProBlak and sponsors to help build a community that can really have an impact for kids from the toughest neighborhoods in the city.</p>
